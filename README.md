# Fake vs Real Job Postings – NLP Capstone

## Problem
Online job platforms are increasingly used to post fraudulent job listings.
The goal of this project was to build machine learning models capable of
classifying job postings as real or fake based on textual and structured features.

## Data
- Job posting datasets from multiple sources
- Text fields (job description, requirements)
- Structured fields (location, salary, benefits)

## Approach
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Baseline models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
- Advanced models (SVM, Decision Trees)
- Ensemble methods
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results
- Best-performing model achieved strong recall for fraudulent postings
- Ensemble approaches improved robustness over individual models

## Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, NLP libraries

## Repository Structure
- `/notebooks` – exploratory analysis and modeling
- `/src` – reusable code
- `/data` – processed datasets
